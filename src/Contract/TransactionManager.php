/**
 * Contract for running work atomically and for deferring side effects until the transaction settles.
 *
 * An application service takes this port rather than a connection, which is what lets a use case compose:
 * calling one service from inside another's transaction joins the scope already open instead of starting
 * a second one, so the same service works standalone and as a step in a larger operation. Nothing here
 * names a connection, a platform or a query builder; the host supplies the adapter that keeps the promise,
 * so a second adapter owes behaviour rather than a shape.
 *
 * The two hooks exist because the effects a use case triggers outside the store — cache eviction, queue
 * writes, filesystem publication — cannot be rolled back, and so must not fire until the work they
 * describe is durable. An implementation owes two guarantees: nesting is invisible to the caller, and a
 * commit hook registered anywhere in a nest waits for the outermost commit, while a rollback hook fires
 * as soon as the scope that registered it is discarded.
 *
 * @since  0.1.0
